- **Disaster Alerts**: National and regional disaster warnings (earthquake, tsunami, typhoon, etc.)
- **Weather Emergencies**: Severe weather and emergency status from JMA and other sources
- **Radiation Monitoring**: Safecast and government radiation levels (ŒºSv/h)
- **Infrastructure Status**: Power, water, gas, and telecom outage monitoring
- **Emergency Services**: Fire, police, medical, and coast guard load/capacity
- **Social Sentiment**: Disaster-related social media analysis
- **Community Reports**: User-generated safety and hazard reports

### Advanced Data Aggregation
- **Multiple APIs**: JMA, Safecast, government, social, and infrastructure APIs
- **Smart Data Fusion**: Aggregates and validates data from multiple sources
- **Real-Time Updates**: Frequent polling for up-to-date information
- **Comprehensive Sensors**: 30+ sensors for disaster, environment, and infrastructure

## üè† Home Assistant Integration

### Installation
1. Copy the `bosai_watch` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Add the Bosai Watch integration via the UI or YAML.

### Secrets File
Create ``bosai_watch_secrets.yaml`` in your Home Assistant configuration
directory to store API keys or passwords.  Each key can then be retrieved
automatically by the integration.  Example:

```yaml
twitter_bearer_token: YOUR_TOKEN
tokyo_metro_key: YOUR_KEY
```

Restart Home Assistant after creating or updating the file so the secrets are
reloaded.
